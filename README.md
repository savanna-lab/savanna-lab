## The whole world is a savanna; forests and grasslands are just special cases

Welcome! The Savanna Lab [(lab members)](https://savannalab.nmsu.edu/people/) at New Mexico State University studies the structure, function, and ecology of arid ecosystems, including the shrublands and grasslands of the Northern Chihuahuan Desert, the grazing lands and savannas of Africa, and the other temperate and tropical drought-seasonal systems of our globe [(our research)](https://savannalab.nmsu.edu/research/). Our research spans diverse spatial and temporal scales, ranging from detailed plot-based experimentation to landscape-scale observations, and finally reaching regional and global scale remote sensing and modeling. We are interested in fundamental ecological theory for arid ecosystem function, applications in grazing land sustainability and pastoral livelihoods, and the implications for global biogeochemical cycles, climate change, and land surface-climate interactions [(our publications)](https://savannalab.nmsu.edu/publications/).
